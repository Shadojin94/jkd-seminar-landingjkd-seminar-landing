feat: Refactor cart for improved UX

This commit refactors the shopping cart to improve user experience.

- Unifies the "Add to Cart" and "Your Cart" sections into a single, streamlined interface.
- Implements automatic quantity updates, removing the need for a separate "Add to Cart" button.
- Automatically removes items from the cart when their quantity is set to 0.
- Updates PayPal configuration to use the production client ID.
